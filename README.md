# RoboCup@Work Missions 2020

Unfortunately, there will be no RoboCup event this year. Therefore we try to keep the enthusiasm of the teams on a high level with some virtual tasks to avoid a standstill. At the same time, we want to encourage the exchange and interaction between the teams.

We have the following competitive missions in mind:
1. identification and localization of @Work objects using labeled images [-> /vision](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/missions/tree/master/vision)
2. optimization of the task sequence based on different cost functions
3. ???

Building on this, we can then return to the usual competition format in 2021 with new impulses. The schedule, parameters, and data sets will be discussed and defined within the next days.
